## 💬 Example Conversations

### Example 1: Maize Pest Problem
**User:** "I see small holes in my maize leaves. What could it be?"

**Chatbot:** "Based on your description of small holes in maize leaves, this could be:

1. **Fall Armyworm** (Most likely)
   - Small holes that enlarge
   - Frass (droppings) visible
   - Active at night

2. **Stem Borer** (Less likely if only leaf damage)

**Recommended Action:**
- Scout early morning for larvae
- Apply Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC @ 0.3 ml/liter
- Or use biological control: Bacillus thuringiensis

**Cost:** ₹800-1200 per acre

Would you like more details on application timing?"

---

### Example 2: Wheat Fertilizer Query
**User:** "My wheat is 30 days old. What fertilizer should I apply?"

**Chatbot:** "At 30 days (tillering stage), your wheat needs:

**First Top Dressing:**
- **Urea**: 65 kg/acre (30 kg N/acre)
- **Timing**: Just before first irrigation
- **Method**: Broadcast and irrigate immediately

**Why Now:**
- Tillering stage needs high nitrogen
- Promotes more tillers = more grain yield
- Critical growth period

**Application Tips:**
- Apply in morning or evening
- Ensure soil moisture
- Irrigate within 24 hours

**Next Application:** 
- Second top dressing at 60 days (jointing stage)

**Cost:** ₹1,300-1,500 per acre

Need help with irrigation timing?"
